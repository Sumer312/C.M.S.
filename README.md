#### Description
This is my first project. In this I had first learnt how to write application logic and connect it to a database. Then I had to learn to 
write some front-end for my app and I went with EJS(Embedded Javascript) which was server side. But I also wanted to integrate a 
WYSIWYG rich text editor therefore I chose react as my framework and quill js as my editor.

#### Motivation
Since this was my first project I just wanted to create something basic. At first this was a plain blogging website with only the ability to create and read
texts. But later I wanted to add more functionality to it therefore I add an image upload functionality via cloudinary, a WYSIWYG rich text editor and the 
ability to delete blogs.
